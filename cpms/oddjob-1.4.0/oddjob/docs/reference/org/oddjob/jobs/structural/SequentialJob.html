    <h1>sequential</h1>
    <hr/>
Executes it's children in a sequence one after the
 other. The sequence will only continue to be executed if each child 
 COMPLETEs. If a child is INCOMPLETE, or throws an EXCEPTION then execution
 will terminate and this job's state will reflect that of the 
 failed child.
 <p>
 This behaviour can be changed by setting the <b><code>independent</code></b>
 property which will cause execution to continue regardless of the last
 executed child state. 
 
 <h4>State Operator</h4>
 
 The <b><code>stateOperator</b></code> property changes the way in which
 this jobs state reflects its child states. Oddjob currently supports the
 following State Operators:
 <dl>
  <dt>ACTIVE</dt>
  <dd>If any child is EXECUTING, ACTIVE or STARTING this job's state
  will be ACTIVE. Otherwise, if a child is STARTED, this job's state 
  will be STARTED. Otherwise, if a child is READY, this job's state will
  be READY. Otherwise, this job's state will reflect the worst state of
  the child jobs.</dd>
  <dt>WORST</dt>
  <dd>This job's state will be EXCEPTION or INCOMPLETE if any of the
  child job's are in this state. Otherwise the rules for ACTIVE apply.</dd>
  <dt>SERVICES</dt>
  <dd>This state operator is designed for starting services. This job
  will COMPLETE when all services are STARTED. If any
  services fails to start this job reflects the EXCEPTION state. 
  Because this job, when using this state operator, completes even though 
  it's children are running, this job is analogous to creating daemon 
  threads in that the services will not stop Oddjob from shutting down 
  once all other jobs have completed.</dd>
 </dl>
  
 <h4>Stopping</h4>
 As with other structural jobs, when this job is stopping, either because
 of a manual stop, or during Oddjob's shutdown cycle, the child jobs and
 services will still be stopped in an reverse order.
 
 <h4>Persistence</h4>
 If this job has an Id and Oddjob is running with a Persister, then
 this job's state will be persisted when it changes. Thus a COMPLETE
 state will be persisted once all child jobs have completed. If Oddjob
 is restarted at this point the COMPLETE state of this job will stop 
 the child job's from re-running, if though they themselves might not
 have been persisted. To stop this job from being persisted set the 
 <code>transient</code> property to true. Not that when starting
 services with this job, persistence is probably not desirable as
 it will stop the services from re-starting.
 
 <h4>Re-running Child Jobs</h4>
 
 If the failed job is later run manually and completes this Job will
 reflect the new state. As such it is useful as a trigger point for 
 the completion of a sequence of jobs.

A simple sequence of two jobs.
 
 <pre class="xml">
&lt;oddjob&gt;
    &lt;job&gt;
        &lt;sequential name="A sequence of two jobs"&gt;
            &lt;jobs&gt;
                &lt;echo&gt;This runs first.&lt;/echo&gt;
                &lt;echo&gt;This runs after.&lt;/echo&gt;
            &lt;/jobs&gt;
        &lt;/sequential&gt;
    &lt;/job&gt;
&lt;/oddjob&gt;</pre>

    </p>
    <a name='example2'><h4>Example 2</h4></a>
    <p>
Starting two services. To perform odd jobs, in a workshop for instance,
 this first 'job' is to turn on the lights and turn on any machines
 required. The service manager encompasses this idea - and this example
 embelishes the idea. Real odd jobs for Oddjob will involve activities 
 such as starting services such as a data source or a server connection.
 The concept however is still the same.
 
 <pre class="xml">
&lt;oddjob&gt;
  &lt;job&gt;
    &lt;sequential&gt;
      &lt;jobs&gt;
      &lt;sequential id="service-manager" stateOperator="SERVICES"&gt;
        &lt;jobs&gt;
          &lt;bean id="lights" class="org.oddjob.jobs.structural.ServiceManagerTest$Lights"/&gt;
          &lt;bean id="machine" class="org.oddjob.jobs.structural.ServiceManagerTest$MachineThatGoes" goes="ping"/&gt;
        &lt;/jobs&gt;
      &lt;/sequential&gt;
      &lt;echo&gt;The lights are ${lights.are} and the machine goes ${machine.goes}.&lt;/echo&gt;
      &lt;/jobs&gt;
    &lt;/sequential&gt;
  &lt;/job&gt;
&lt;/oddjob&gt;</pre>

 
 The services are started in order. Once both services have started
 a job is performed that requires both services. If this configuration
 were running from the command line, Oddjob would stop the services
 as it shut down. First the machine would be turned of and then finally
 the lights would be turned out.
