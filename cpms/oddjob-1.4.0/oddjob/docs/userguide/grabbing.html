	<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
	
	<p>Oddjob can share work between any number of servers and
	so long as one server remains operational, any of the others
	can fail, and work will still be done.</p>

	<p>Sharing work is achieved by having jobs grab for work. A
	Keeper guards the work and ensures only one job does the guarded
	bit of work.</p>
	
	<p>A instance of work that can be grabbed is identified by a 
	key and an instance id. The key identifies the work such as
	'Report-26' and the instance is the instance of execution of the
	work such as the date it's running for.</p>
	
	<p>The grabbers also have an identifier. This allows the grabber
	to keep track of who's won. The loosing grabbers display who's 
	won so you know from any server where the work is being done.
	The keeper also notifies the looses when the winner has finished
	the job.</p>

	<p>Now the Keeper must have some central thing on which to
	coordinate work. Currently the only implemented Keeper is one
	that uses a database, but the concept is simple and open to
	clever developers to implement with distributed caching or 
	JMS or any other technology that supports the distributed ordering
	of things.</p>

	<h4 id="simple">A Simple Example</h4>
	
	<p>Here's a simple example where two parallel processes compete
	for work. This example uses a sequence number to differentiate
	between work instances. The sequence number of parallel 
	job must be manually re-run to grab again. Re-running the
	parallel job or one of the grabbers demonstrates how the keeper
	guards against work being re-done.</p>

	<h4 id="scheduling">Distributed Scheduling</h4>
	
	<p>Grabbing for work and Oddjobs existing scheduling can be used together to
	implement distributed scheduling.</p>
	
	<p>The Resiliance Example shows how three Oddjobs running the same timer
	configuration compete for work and there-by distribute the scheduling
	between them.
	</p>

	<p>The work takes 15 seconds, and the schedule is every 10 seconds. To keep
	up with the work at least 2 workers need to be running. With 3 workers
	running, 1 worker is always idle. The Grab Job's <code>onLoosing</code>
	property is set to INCOMPLETE so we can easily see which job this is.
